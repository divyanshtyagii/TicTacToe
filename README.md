# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java. It allows two players to take turns entering their moves on a 3x3 grid.

## How to Play

1. Compile the Java file: `javac TicTacToe.java`
2. Run the compiled program: `java TicTacToe`
3. Follow the prompts to enter your moves. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers (both ranging from 1 to 3).

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can input their moves via the console.
- **Win Condition Detection:** The game checks for winning combinations after each move, including rows, columns, and diagonals.
- **Draw Detection:** If no player achieves a win, the game detects when the board is fully filled without a winner, declaring the game as a draw.
- **Play Again:** At the end of each game, players have the option to play again.
